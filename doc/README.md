The tests case shown in this documentation are going to use the Catch2 framework. But there is no direct dependency between FSeam and any testing framework (you can use [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), [CppUnit](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CppUnit) or any [other testing framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C++) with FSeam).
